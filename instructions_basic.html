<b>About this HIT:</b><br><br>
<ul>
    <li><b>Please only participate in this HIT if you have normal color vision and hearing.</b></li><br>

    <li><b>You may hear some harsh or uncomfortable sound during the test, so please make sure to adjust your device's volume to proper range before the test. We also strongly encourage you to use an earphone during the test</b></li><br>
    
    <li>It should take about 5 minutes.</li><br>
    
    <li>You will take part in an experiment involving visual and hearing perception. You will see a series of videos in the group. Each group contains four individual videos, and we call them the target, conditional, video A, and video B, respectively. The target video is silent while others have sound. The sound in videos A and B are made so that they are synchronized with the target video's action but have timbre like the conditional video. Namely, the sound in videos A and B should sound like the material presented in the conditional video but match with the action in the target video.</li><br>

    <li>Your task is to identify, between video A and B, which is better in synchronization with the target, and which has a timbre closer to the conditional video.</li>
    
    <li>You will complete a short practice (less than 1 minute) before starting the main task to get familiar with the interface.</li>
