    <li>The task should take approximately 15 minutes to complete.</li><br>
    
    <li>You will take part in an experiment involving visual and hearing perception. To complete this task, you will need to watch and listen to 20 groups of videos and answer two questions for each group. Each group consists of:<ul>
        <li>Two input videos: Video #1 (video with no audio), Video #2 (video with audio)</li>
        <li>Two output videos (both videos have audio): Video #3 and Video #4</li>
    </ul></li><br>

    <li>Your task is to answer the two questions at the bottom: <ul>
        <li>Which output video's audio is better <i>synchronized in time</i> with the action depicted in the <b>Video #1</b>?</li>
        <li>Which output video's audio sounds like the <i>material/object</i> presented in the <b>Video #2</b>?</li>
    </ul></li>
    
    <li>You will complete a short practice of 5 groups of videos (about 3 minute long) before starting the main task, so that you can get familiar with the interface.</li>
